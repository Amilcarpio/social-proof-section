## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The media queries properties was the most challenge for me, also put the stars above the list was a nightmare, but i'm proud to finish this project.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    .star-1 {
    position: relative;
    width: 20px;
    z-index: 1;
    left: 60px;
    top: 20px;
    }
```
### Continued development

I want to keep proving a better workflow schema, be more efficient and fast with the css and in the future invest on a css framework.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/333670/elemento-sobrepondo-o-outro-css) - This helped me to put the stars above the list div. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
